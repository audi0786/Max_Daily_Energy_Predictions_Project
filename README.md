## Project Overview

This project analyzes the electricity consumption of Melbourne from 01.01.2021 to 31.08.2021. It is often observed that electricity consumption has strong relation with weather, especially temperature and time of the year/season. We will analyze the relationship of electricity consumption in Melbourne based on various weather features like temperature, wind, month and so on. The goal here is to predict the electricity consumption of the city based on weather forecast. 

Our stakeholders, the electricity providers, can use this model to plan for the expected demand and hence make arrangements as participants of National Electricity Market(NEM) to lock in the expected demand at the right price.

## Data:

The following two datasets are used:
1. price_demand_data.csv: This excel contains price and demand for each 30 minutes period from 01.01.2021 to 31.08.2021, for Victoria, Australia. RRP column has been removed from the data. For more details, please refer to the data source: https://aemo.com.au/energy-systems/electricity/national-electricity-market-nem/data-nem/aggregated-data

2. weather_data.csv: contains various weather features like temperature, wind pressure, wind direction and so forth, for each day from 01.01.2021 to 31.08.2021.
