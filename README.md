## Project Overview

1. This project analyzes the electricity consumption of Melbourne from 01.01.2021 to 31.08.2021. It is often observed that electricity consumption has strong relation with weather, especially temperature and time of the year/season. We will analyze the relationship of electricity consumption in Melbourne based on various weather features like temperature, wind, month and so on. The goal here is to predict the electricity consumption of the city based on weather forecast. 

Our stakeholders, the electricity providers, can use this model to plan for the expected demand and hence make arrangements to meet demand accordingly. 

2. They are looking for insights whether houses are overpriced/underpriced and what is the impact of factors like waterfront, view and renovations on a house price.
